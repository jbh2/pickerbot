ECE 470 Project 

Team members: Jenny Chu, Joseph Hong, Mohamed Radwan

This repository is for the pickerbot fruit picking robot simulation for ECE 470. This project will be using V-REP version 3.6.0. The goal of this project is to simulate a robot that can move on its own, while picking fruits from a tree. Secondary goals include moving from one tree to the next, and sorting different types of fruits into bins. 

For the Project Update 1, we will demonstrate our robot picking up an object that is already in its field of view (FOV). The robot will use a gripper tool and a 3D vision camera.
